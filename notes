LEARNING RULE
    Wij = Wij + Å‹(Tj - Yj) * Xi
    weight = weight + learningRate(target - output) * input         multiplying by input to maintain right sign, if input was negative, somethingsomething

BIAS INPUT
    A node with value -1 connected to all neurons. By regulating this, one can avoid the problem of having a neuron fire when the input is 0.

CONFUSION MATRIX
        C1  C2  C3              Used to see how well the ANN has performed
    C1  1   0   0
    C2  0   1   0               Y = TARGETS, X = OUTPUTS
    C3  0   0   1               ALLA RETT!!
